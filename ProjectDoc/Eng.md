# Project Documentation: Tuttiud Student Support Platform

**Version: 2.10.3**
**Last Updated: 2025-10-26**

> **Developer Conventions:** For folder structure, naming rules, API patterns, and feature organization, refer to [Conventions.md](./Conventions.md).

## 1. Vision & Purpose

Tuttiud helps education teams coordinate instruction, track student progress, and keep each organization in control of its data. The first public release focuses on the core daily workflows shared by every customer:

- Administrators provision the tenant database once, back up the org, create students, and assign each student to an instructor.
- Instructors sign in with their organization, view only the students they are responsible for, and capture structured session records after every meeting.
- Both roles rely on a secure onboarding wizard that guarantees every tenant starts from the exact same schema and role configuration.

## 2. Architecture & Technology Stack

- **Desktop shell:** Electron packaged with electron-builder for Windows/macOS. Launches the React SPA inside a dedicated window or the default browser.
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui. Routing uses a `HashRouter` to remain desktop friendly. All secure operations funnel through context providers (`SupabaseProvider`, `OrgProvider`).
- **Backend/API:** Azure Functions host the `/api/*` proxy endpoints. Every handler validates the caller’s Supabase JWT, checks organization membership, decrypts the dedicated tenant key, and then performs reads/writes with a server-side Supabase client (`tenantClient`).
- **Data Platform:** Each organization owns a Supabase Postgres project. The canonical schema lives in the `tuttiud` namespace and is created through the setup wizard’s SQL script. Row Level Security is enforced for every table.

## 3. Canonical Database Setup

The **only** supported bootstrap path is the SQL script stored in [`src/lib/setup-sql.js`](../src/lib/setup-sql.js). It is exposed verbatim to admins in the onboarding wizard and may be re-run safely at any time.

Key characteristics:

1. Creates the `tuttiud` schema and the tables `Instructors`, `Students`, `SessionRecords`, and `Settings`.
2. Enables RLS for every table and installs permissive policies (`Allow full access...`) for the authenticated role during MVP phase.
3. Creates the reusable `app_user` role and grants usage/select privileges.
4. Defines `tuttiud.setup_assistant_diagnostics()` which now confirms schema + table existence, verifies RLS + policies on every MVP table, and checks the critical indexes used by instructor/student dashboards.
5. Applies `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` statements so rerunning the script will backfill newly required columns on existing tenants without dropping data.
6. Generates a five-year JWT named `APP_DEDICATED_KEY (COPY THIS BACK TO THE APP)` that the admin pastes back into the wizard. The key is later encrypted and stored in the Control DB via `/api/save-org-credentials`.

## 4. Data Model (MVP)

| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
| :---- | :------ | :---------- |
| `tuttiud."Instructors"` | Directory of teaching staff. | `id` (uuid PK storing `auth.users.id`, enforced by the application layer), `name`, contact fields, `is_active`, `metadata` |
| `tuttiud."Students"` | Student roster for the organization. | `id`, `name`, `contact_info`, `contact_name`, `contact_phone`, `assigned_instructor_id` (FK → `Instructors.id`), `default_day_of_week` (1 = Sunday, 7 = Saturday), `default_session_time`, `default_service`, `tags`, `notes`, `metadata` |
| `tuttiud."SessionRecords"` | Canonical record of every instruction session. | `id`, `date`, `student_id` (FK → `Students.id`), `instructor_id` (FK → `Instructors.id`), `service_context`, `content` (JSON answers map), `deleted`, timestamps, `metadata` |
| `tuttiud."Settings"` | JSON configuration bucket per tenant. | `id`, `key` (unique), `settings_value` |

Supporting indexes:

- `SessionRecords_student_date_idx` for chronological student lookups.
- `SessionRecords_instructor_idx` for instructor dashboards.

> **Instructor identity mapping:** Because the tenant database lives in a separate project from the control-plane auth store, `tuttiud."Instructors".id` is not backed by a database-level foreign key. The application is responsible for writing the correct `auth.users.id` when creating instructors and for keeping those mappings in sync.

## 5. Security Model & Keys

- RLS is enabled for every table. During the MVP all authenticated users have full access. Instructors can still be scoped in the application layer (filters by `assigned_instructor_id`). Future releases can tighten RLS without altering client code.
- The wizard captures the dedicated JWT generated by the SQL script. The frontend never stores it in plaintext; `/api/save-org-credentials` encrypts the value with `APP_ORG_CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` before saving it to the Control DB (`organizations.dedicated_key_encrypted`).
- Serverless endpoints decrypt the key only while creating the privileged `tenantClient`. The browser keeps using the anon key for read-only diagnostics (`tuttiud.setup_assistant_diagnostics`) and must proxy all writes through `/api/*`.

## 6. Setup Wizard Flow (Settings → Supabase Setup)

Implemented in [`src/components/settings/SetupAssistant.jsx`](../src/components/settings/SetupAssistant.jsx):

1. **Database Preparation** – Presents the canonical SQL, explains how to run it in the Supabase SQL Editor, and reminds the admin to copy the JWT output.
2. **Provide the Application Key** – Offers a dedicated textarea + clipboard helper for the JWT (`APP_DEDICATED_KEY`). The key stays local until the admin explicitly saves it.
3. **Validation** – Runs `tuttiud.setup_assistant_diagnostics()` via the anon Supabase client. The function returns pass/fail rows for schema, RLS, policy, and index coverage. When all checks succeed the wizard posts the JWT to `/api/save-org-credentials`, which encrypts the key, persists `dedicated_key_saved_at`, `verified_at`, and `setup_completed`, and the UI records the verification timestamp before unlocking the rest of the app. Errors surface in-line with actionable guidance and keep the wizard on the same step for retry.

The wizard always tracks loading, error, and success states, ensuring accessibility (`aria-live`) and RTL support.

## 7. Core API Endpoints & MVP Feature Support

### 7.1 Serverless API Contracts

| Route | Method | Audience | Purpose |
| :---- | :----- | :------- | :------ |
| `/api/instructors` | GET | Admin/Owner | Reads `tuttiud."Instructors"` (defaulting to active rows) and returns instructor records keyed by their Supabase auth user ID (`id`). |
| `/api/students` | GET | Admin/Owner | Returns every `tuttiud."Students"` row ordered by name, including scheduling defaults and contact fields. |
| `/api/students` | POST | Admin/Owner | Inserts a student (name + optional contact data, scheduling defaults, instructor assignment) and echoes the created row. |
| `/api/students/{studentId}` | PUT | Admin/Owner | Updates mutable student fields (name, contact data, scheduling defaults, instructor) and returns the refreshed row or 404. |
| `/api/my-students` | GET | Member/Admin/Owner | Filters the roster by `assigned_instructor_id === caller.id` (Supabase auth UUID), supporting the instructor dashboard. |
| `/api/sessions` | POST | Member/Admin/Owner | Inserts a `SessionRecords` entry (JSON answer payload + optional service context) after confirming members only write for students assigned to them. |
| `/api/settings` | GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE | Admin/Owner (read allowed to members) | Provides full CRUD for tenant settings, supporting creation of new keys like `session_form_config`. |

> **Schema guardrails:** `/api/settings` now inspects `tuttiud.setup_assistant_diagnostics()` whenever Supabase reports missing tables or insufficient permissions. Schema or policy gaps surface as HTTP 424 with `settings_schema_incomplete` / `settings_schema_unverified` and include the failing diagnostic rows so admins can rerun the setup script before retrying.

All endpoints expect the tenant identifier (`org_id`) in the request body or query string. Authentication is enforced with the Supabase JWT provided by the desktop/web client, and every handler builds the tenant Supabase client through `api/_shared/org-bff.js` to reuse encryption, membership, and error handling routines.

### 7.2 User Story Mapping

| User Story | Implementation Notes |
| :--------- | :------------------- |
| **Instructor creates & manages session records** | `/api/sessions` writes into `SessionRecords` after verifying (for members) that the student belongs to them. Future endpoints can extend to edit/delete using the same helper. |
| **Instructor sees only assigned students** | `/api/my-students` scopes the roster by `assigned_instructor_id = caller.id`, so instructors never receive other students even before frontend filtering. |
| **Administrator manages roster & assignments** | `/api/students` (POST/PUT) plus `/api/instructors` give admins the CRUD surface to create students and assign them to instructors. |
| **Administrator views full roster + instructor pairing** | `/api/students` (GET) returns the entire roster and includes assignments, allowing the admin UI to render organization-wide dashboards. |

## 8. Developer Notes

- Keep `SETUP_SQL_SCRIPT` as the single source of truth; import it anywhere the script must be displayed (wizard, docs, etc.).
- `verifyOrgConnection` (`src/runtime/verification.js`) now expects a Supabase data client and returns the diagnostics array so callers can render pass/fail status.
- All onboarding status updates should call `recordVerification(orgId, timestamp)` to persist `setup_completed` / `verified_at` on the control-plane organization row.
- Documentation must remain bilingual (see `ProjectDoc/Heb.md`) and the README should highlight the onboarding checklist for quick reference.
- OAuth flows call `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth` with `options.redirectTo`, resolving to the full browser URL (`origin + pathname + search + hash`) when `window.location` is available or falling back to `VITE_PUBLIC_APP_URL`/`VITE_APP_BASE_URL`/`VITE_SITE_URL` so each shell returns users to the exact page that initiated the Tuttiud login after third-party authentication.
- `src/pages/Login.jsx` inspects Supabase OAuth callback parameters on mount, surfaces friendly Hebrew error messages (e.g., invitation-only orgs), clears loading states, and removes the stale query string so subsequent login attempts start cleanly.
- `resolveRedirectUrl()` in `src/auth/AuthContext.jsx` now strips Supabase callback parameters before returning the redirect so failed attempts do not pollute future OAuth requests.
- Password reset is a two-step Supabase Auth flow: `/Pages/ForgotPassword.jsx` calls `resetPasswordForEmail` with a redirect to `/#/update-password`, and `/Pages/UpdatePassword.jsx` verifies matching credentials before calling the new `updatePassword` helper exposed by `AuthContext`. Both views use the refreshed design system components and RTL-friendly alerts for loading, success, and error states.
- The login form surfaces Supabase authentication failures inline using the red error alert pattern so users immediately see when credentials are invalid.

## 9. Admin Student Management UI

- **Feature slice** – all admin-only UI now lives in `src/features/admin/`. Components scoped to this feature sit under `components/` while page-level containers are housed in `pages/`.
- **StudentManagementPage.jsx** – renders the `/admin/students` route. It reads the active organization from `OrgContext`, fetches `/api/students` on mount, surfaces loading/error/empty states, and keeps an instructor map in memory for display. Dialog state is managed locally for add/edit flows.
- **AddStudentForm.jsx** – collects `name` and `contactInfo`, enforces client-side validation, and raises `onSubmit` with trimmed values. The form is rendered inside a dialog launched from the Student Management page.
- **AssignInstructorModal.jsx** – opens from each roster row, requests `/api/instructors` when displayed, and submits the chosen instructor through `PUT /api/students/{id}`. It blocks dismissals while saving and emits `onAssigned` so the page can refresh the roster.
- **Roster deep links** – student names now link to `/students/:id`, sending admins directly into the dedicated detail page without leaving the management workflow.
- **App shell & routing** – `src/main.jsx` redirects `/Employees` to `/admin/students` and wraps authenticated routes with `src/components/layout/AppShell.jsx`. The shell renders a bottom tab bar + FAB on mobile and a left sidebar on desktop while keeping the student management view front and center.

## 10. Instructor "My Students" Dashboard

- **Feature slice** – the instructor experience now lives under `src/features/instructor/`. Shared-only components stay in
  `components/`, while the `MyStudentsPage.jsx` container resides in `pages/` and wires the full view state.
- **Page layout & routing** – `MyStudentsPage.jsx` composes the shared `PageLayout` shell, calls `GET /api/my-students` once the
  organization connection is ready, and renders loading, error, and empty states. Successful fetches map each student to a
  `Card` showing their name and contact details.
- **Drill-down access** – each card includes a "צפייה בפרטי התלמיד" link to `/students/:id`, giving instructors a one-click path into the shared detail page while keeping the roster lightweight.
- **Navigation updates** – `AppShell.jsx` derives the Students destination from the member role so admins/owners keep
  `/admin/students` while instructors are routed to `/my-students`. The router (`src/main.jsx`) exposes the `/my-students`
  path so instructors land on their filtered roster.

## 11. Focused Navigation Dashboard

- **DashboardPage.jsx** – located at `src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx`, this lightweight home view greets the authenticated user and
  presents two prominent actions: navigating to `/my-students` and opening the session registration modal via the floating + button.
- **Home routing** – the `AppShell` "ראשי" link now points to `/`, and `/Dashboard` redirects to the new landing page so the
  simplified experience becomes the default route after login. All auth redirects (login, org selection, invite acceptance)
  now target `/` as the canonical destination.
- **Reports link state** – the "דוחות" navigation item is disabled in both mobile and desktop shells. Hovering or long-pressing
  shows the tooltip "Reporting features coming soon!", preventing dead-end navigation while communicating the roadmap.

## 12. Design System Foundations (Mobile-First UI Kit)

- **Tailwind configuration** – `tailwind.config.js` now defines a Nunito-based typography stack, a calm violet primary palette (`primary`), accessible neutral grays (`neutral`), and dedicated status colors for success, warning, and error states. The spacing scale introduces tokens (`2xs` → `3xl`) sized for generous touch targets and breathing room on small screens.
- **UI primitives** – Generic components for the new design live in [`src/components/ui/Button.jsx`](../src/components/ui/Button.jsx), [`Card.jsx`](../src/components/ui/Card.jsx), [`Input.jsx`](../src/components/ui/Input.jsx), and [`PageLayout.jsx`](../src/components/ui/PageLayout.jsx). Use them when building new flows to guarantee consistent padding, typography, and contrast across mobile and desktop breakpoints.
- **Progressive adoption** – Existing pages remain unchanged for now. Future tickets will migrate feature screens to the new layout by composing these primitives.

## 13. Student Detail & Session Registration Flow

- **StudentDetailPage.jsx** – new route `/students/:id` shared by admins and instructors. It fetches the selected student via the appropriate roster endpoint, renders contact + scheduling defaults, and displays session history with graceful fallbacks when the history endpoint is not yet available.
- **Session history rendering** – the page loads `session_form_config` through `/api/settings?keys=session_form_config`, normalizes questions with `parseSessionFormConfig`, and maps stored JSON answers back to their Hebrew labels. A 404 from the forthcoming `/api/session-records` endpoint is treated as “no sessions recorded” so UI scaffolding is testable today.
- **SessionModalContext.jsx** – provided by `AppShell.jsx`, exposing `openSessionModal({ studentId, onCreated })` to any routed page. It keeps modal state in a single location so the FAB, desktop CTA, and Student Detail page all share the same creation flow.
- **NewSessionModal.jsx** – orchestrates data dependencies: loads the student roster (admin vs. instructor scope), fetches `session_form_config`, and surfaces loading/error states. On submit it posts to `/api/sessions` with `{ student_id, date, service_context, content }` and triggers any supplied `onCreated` callback before closing.
- **NewSessionForm.jsx** – Hebrew UI for the session questionnaire. It pre-selects the active student when invoked from the detail page, shows each student’s default day/time beside their name, pre-fills the service field, and collects answers for every configured question (text, textarea, select, radio/button groups, numeric fields, and range scales). Empty responses are stripped before sending the payload.
- **Shared utilities** – `src/features/students/utils/schedule.js` centralizes day/time formatting, `src/features/students/utils/endpoints.js` standardizes roster endpoint selection, and `src/features/sessions/utils/form-config.js` parses question configs so both the modal and detail view stay in sync.

## 14. Session Form Management in Settings

- **Modernized Settings page** – `/Pages/Settings.jsx` now focuses on diagnostics, Supabase connectivity, invitations, and the new session form manager. Legacy leave policy, holiday, and employment scope panels were removed to keep the page scoped to Tuttiud’s current feature set.
- **Role-based access** – only administrators and organization owners render the management surface. Members/instructors still see the debugging card but no longer receive any administrative controls.
- **SessionFormManager.jsx** – located at `src/components/settings/SessionFormManager.jsx`, this card loads the existing `session_form_config`, lists all questions, and lets admins add, edit, reorder, or delete entries before saving. Each question tracks `id`, `label`, `type`, `placeholder`, `required`, `options`, and (for range scales) numeric bounds. A dedicated “Save changes” button persists updates via `upsertSetting`, while inline validation prevents duplicate IDs, missing labels, or invalid option/range data.
- **Improved parsing utilities** – `parseSessionFormConfig` now preserves `required`, `options`, and `range` metadata so runtime consumers (session modal/detail views) can render richer controls while staying backward compatible with minimal configs.
- **Option persistence** – Server-side normalization (`api/settings/index.js`) now keeps option objects with their `value`, `label`, and optional `id` fields when saving configurations, preventing `[object Object]` strings and ensuring the SessionFormManager reloads distinct labels/values exactly as entered.
- **Session capture parity** – `NewSessionForm.jsx` honors the expanded question types, rendering selects, radio/button groups, numeric/date inputs, and sliders alongside the existing text areas. Required fields are enforced client-side and the payload continues to trim empty responses before submission.

## 15. Admin Tools

### Backup Verification Script

A Node.js script is provided for super admins/system administrators to verify backup file integrity and decryptability:

- **Location:** `test/verify-backup.cjs`
- **Usage:**
  ```
  node test/verify-backup.cjs <backup-file-path> <password>
  ```
- **Features:**
  - Loads and decrypts a backup file using the provided password
  - Prints manifest summary if successful
  - Prints error if file is invalid or password is incorrect

This tool is essential for validating backups before restore or for compliance checks.
