# Issue: Outdated GitHub Action Versions

**Severity:** 4 (Low - Works fine but missing improvements and security patches)

## Problem
The workflow uses outdated versions of GitHub Actions, missing out on performance improvements, bug fixes, and security patches.

## Current Versions
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3              # Latest is v4
- uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1  # May have newer versions
```

## Why This Matters

### Security
- Older actions may have known security vulnerabilities
- Newer versions include security patches

### Performance
- `@v4` of `actions/checkout` has better performance
- Optimized Git operations and caching

### Features
- Newer versions may have better comment management (fixes spam issue)
- Improved error messages and debugging
- Better compatibility with latest GitHub features

### Maintenance
- Older versions may eventually be deprecated
- Actions community focuses support on latest versions

## Recommended Updates

### Update Checkout Action
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Current: v3
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster checkout times
- Better handling of large repositories
- Improved submodule support

### Check Azure Deploy Action Version
Research and update to latest stable version:
```yaml
- uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1  # Check for v2 or latest
```

**Note:** Check Azure's documentation for breaking changes before updating.

## Implementation Steps
1. Check [actions/checkout releases](https://github.com/actions/checkout/releases) for latest version
2. Check [Azure/static-web-apps-deploy releases](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-deploy/releases)
3. Update version numbers
4. Test in a PR to ensure no breaking changes
5. Monitor first few deployments after update

## Risk Level
**Low** - Updates typically maintain backward compatibility, but always test first.
